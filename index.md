My name is Madeline Bloomberg. I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto in the Perception, Cognition, and Cognitive Neuroscience program working in the 
[Mack Lab](https://macklab.utoronto.ca) under the supervision of Dr. Michael Mack.

I have 5 years of research experience, including experimental design, participant recruitment, data collection and analysis and project management. Some of my current research interests include:

  **Interactions between memory and attention** <br> How does our where we place our attention impact what we remember from our environments and how do our prior memories guide our attention?

  **Individual differences in learning and memory** br> Why do people differ in the way they learn and remember information, and what cognitive or neural factors shape these individual patterns?
    
  **Mechanisms that support memory creation and memory updating** br> What brain and cognitive processes allow us to form new memories while still adapting old ones? When we encounter conflicting information, how does the mind decide whether to integrate it or keep it separate?

I'm always excitd to discuss my research interests and collaborate on new ideas. Feel free to reach out to me for a chat or to connect with me on LinkedIn. You can also checkout my Google Scholar page.
